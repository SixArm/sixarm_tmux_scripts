# Launch tmux with a sesson and windows suitable for Rails development.
#
# Syntax:
#
#     tmux-wins-rails [session-name]
#
# Example:
#
#     cd myapp
#     tmux-wins-rails
#
#
# ## What this does
#
# The script attaches to session-name.
#
#   * If the session doesn't exist, then this creates it.
#   * The _session-name_ defaults to the basename of the pwd.
#
# The script launches these windows with these commands:
#
#   * 1:ed (editor) = `$EDITOR`
#   * 2:qa (quality assurance) = `rake test`
#   * 3:ll (log listing) = `cd log && tail -f $RAILS_ENV.log`
#   * 4:cc (console) = `rails console`
#   * 5:db (database) = `rails db -p`
#   * 6:ws (webserver) = `rails server`
#   * 7:bg (background misc. work, such as command line tools)
#   * 8:cd (continuous deployment, such as integration and delivery)
#   * 9:op (operations monitoring, such as metrics and analytics) 
#
# ## Commands
#
# This script will choose the "rails" command:
#
#   * If the $RAILS env var is set, then use it.
#   * If "bin/rails" is runnable, then use it.
#   * If "bundle" command is runnable, then use "bundle exec rails".
#
# This script will do the same as above for the "rake" command.
